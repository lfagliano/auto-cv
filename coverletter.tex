\begin{cvletter}

I am writing to express my interest in the ETL Developer position at ABN AMRO, as described in the job posting. With a comprehensive background in Data Engineering and DevOps, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team, leveraging my expertise in creating and monitoring ETL pipelines and my readiness to expand my skills in Azure cloud infrastructure.

Currently, as a Data Officer at the Armed Conflict Location and Events Data Project (ACLED), I have developed a profound skill set in cloud infrastructure and data pipeline management, predominantly in environments other than Azure. Although I have not directly worked with Azure, my experience with other cloud providers has provided me with a strong foundation in cloud computing principles and practices. I am highly enthusiastic about the prospect of broadening my expertise by diving into Azure technologies and am confident in my ability to rapidly assimilate and excel in this new environment.

My experience in YAML has been largely through the implementation of Github Actions. This experience has honed my skills in CI/CD tooling, a key component of the role at ABN AMRO. I am adept at using these skills to enhance operational efficiencies and ensure the seamless execution of development pipelines.

One of my key strengths is the unique combination of DevOps and Data Engineering skills. This dual capability allows me not only to develop robust ETL pipelines but also to effectively monitor and optimize them. In my current role, I have been instrumental in deploying and managing various data engineering tools and ensuring their optimal performance. This experience has provided me with a holistic understanding of the data life cycle, from creation and extraction to transformation and loading, making me well-equipped to handle the responsibilities of an ETL Developer at ABN AMRO.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work within an agile DevOps team at ABN AMRO. I am eager to bring my collaborative spirit, problem-solving skills, and technical expertise to your esteemed team. I look forward to the prospect of contributing to the reporting processes for DNB, ECB, and tax authorities, and being part of a team that thrives on innovation and continuous improvement.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my blend of skills and eagerness to learn to ABN AMRO and contribute to your team’s success. I am looking forward to the possibility of discussing my application further.
